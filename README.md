# flutter_create

Submission to the flutter_create contest by Avinash Rath.

## Introduction

The main idea behind this submission is to give the user of the app
the choice for their own Progress Indicator while they are waiting for
their app to load the data. The user can choose from an array of custom
made Animations to apply it to their app, and the same animation will
be used for the displaying the progress indicator throughout the app.

## Something unusual

Since there is limit to the .dart file size in this contest, all of the 
code documentation is done in the mainDocumented.txt file.
